# UK-Historical-Weather-Shiny-App

This was a project during my MSc Statistics course which required the build of a shiny app in R. 

The app looks at ways of displaying historic weather data in the uk - through which weather trends can be seen visually through time.

The remit was to produce an app for children and therefore language and interactivity were important points to consider.

In this application, I made the first tab - the interactive map.

If you check it out, be sure to change the months and years and the different variable types (e.g max temperature, days of frost in a month, rainfaill etc). 


Click <a href="https://rypoll.shinyapps.io/UK_Historic_Data/">here</a> to view the shiny app - and give it 10 seconds to download the data and display.
